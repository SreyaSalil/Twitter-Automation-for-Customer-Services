Hi, I just got my new fitbit. How do I get started?
Hello, Follow the instructions provided to register your device on Fitbit.com. Go to your 10K-A-Day account and click on the Connect Fitbit Device link on the Getting Started page or the Profile link at the top, then scroll to the bottom of the page to Connect. Is there anything else I can help with?
No that's all
Glad I could help. Thanks for choosing FitBit CustCare and Have a nice day.

Hello, Do I have to manually log my steps every day if I use my Fitbit?
No. As long as your Fitbit is within 10 feet of the wireless USB dongle, it will automatically download your steps to your 10K-A-Day account. Is there anything else I can help with?
That's all.
Glad I could help. Thank you for choosing FitBit CustCare.

Can I use any tracking device to sync to my 10K-A-Day account?
10K-A-Day is currently configured to work only with pedometers from the Fitbit family (Zip™, One™, Flex™, Alta™, Charge HR™, Blaze™, Surge™). Are you already using a Fitbit?
Yes
Connect your device by going to the Profile link on your 10K-A-Day account and click Connect; you’ll be directed to Fitbit.com. Sign in to Fitbit (use your Fitbit account email and password); press Allow to sync your steps with 10K-A-Day.
Thank you so much!

I got no weekly report via email yesterday - any reason why?

Hi! I got the Fitbit Versa 2 for Christmas last year and the strap has broken? The pin part has ripped completely through on one strap?
Hi. Got it! The warranty is limited to one claim per device every four months. Please see http://myhelp.fitbit.com/s/warranty to file the issue and determine if the issue qualifies for a band replacement. If you don’t qualify, you can visit http://fitbit.com/store to view options for purchasing a new band. Stay safe and healthy.

Seems my Fitbit is having issues. Been to bed by 11 on all three nights.
We recommend wearing your device in a snug wristband while sleeping; don’t wear your device in a clip or pendant accessory. When your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep. 
Oh...Okay. I'll look into that.

My Fitbit did not record my sleep pattern. Said I was awake all night!
Your sleep pattern includes your time spent awake, restless, and asleep. Restless sleep indicates that you moved in your sleep, like tossing and turning. If your device detects excessive movement—enough that restful sleep would not be possible—your device records time spent awake.
Okay. That makes sense

Hey, How is my time asleep calculated in the Fitbit app?

My FitBit dies down during the night and I can’t check my sleep stats. This thing is useless
Hi, sorry to hear that. Recording sleep stats impacts your device’s battery, so we recommend charging your device to at least 40% before going to bed. 

My FitBit can’t pick up my snores
Hello, if there’s too much background noise, your device’s microphone can’t pick up snoring. For best results, don’t play white noise or other ambient sounds during sleep.
I don’t think there’s any background noise

Okay. Thank you

I can’t tell the difference between the normal and sensitive sleep setting. Help?
Hi, In normal mode, when you make significant movements like rolling over, your device records time spent awake. This setting is appropriate for most users. In sensitive mode, your device records nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake. This setting may be helpful if you wake up feeling tired even though your sleep history shows sufficient rest.
Wow, cool. How do you change the sensitivity settings?
Sure, could you please tell me the type of device you are using?
